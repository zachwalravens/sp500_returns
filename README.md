## Analysis of S&P 500 Returns as a Stochastic Process

### Motivation

I want to answer the question: If I invest $100 in the S&P 500 today, how much will that investment be worth in 10 years?

Unfortunately, without a crystal ball, no one can answer that question.

However, we can look at historical data and answer this related question. If you invested $100 dollars in the S&P 500 some day beteen 1945 and 10 years ago, how much would your investment probably be worth after 10 years? The answer:
* There's an 99% chance your investment would be worth at least $67
* There's a 95% chance your investment would be worth at least $75
* There's an 80% chance your investment would be worth at least $117
* There's a 50% chance your investment would be worth at least $226
* There's a 20% chance your investment would be worth at least $317
* There's a 5% chance your investment would be worth at least $408
* There's a 1% chance your investment would be worth at least $493
